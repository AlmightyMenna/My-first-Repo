    My academic goal are as follows;
1. Strengthen Core Academic Performance
Maintain strong grades—especially in Mathematics, ICT, and Science—by dedicating consistent study hours each week and actively seeking support in challenging topics.
2. Build Foundational Data Science Skills
Complete introductory courses in Python programming, data analysis, and statistics using online platforms like Coursera, DataCamp, or Khan Academy to build a strong technical base.
3. Improve Research and Analytical Thinking
Engage in small research projects, data-related assignments, or personal experiments to develop problem-solving skills and analytical reasoning essential for data science.
4. Develop Strong Study Habits and Time Management
Create a weekly study timetable and follow it strictly, ensuring balanced time for assignments, revision, and independent learning.

5. Enhance Communication and Presentation Skills
Practice writing structured reports, doing presentations, and explaining complex ideas clearly—skills that are crucial for any data-focused career.

6. Participate in Academic Clubs or Tech Communities
Join a school ICT club, coding club, or local tech community to gain exposure, collaborate with peers, and grow your practical skills.

7. Build a Personal Portfolio Project
Work on at least one data-related mini project, such as analyzing school data, sports statistics, or simple datasets, to demonstrate your growing skills.

8. Read Widely and Expand Knowledge
Read books, articles, and technology blogs at least twice a week to stay informed about trends in data science, AI, and digital transformation.
